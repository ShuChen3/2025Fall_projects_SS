## Monti Carlo Simulation of Strategy Optimization in Yahtzee
IS597PR Fall2025 - Final Project

Team Members: Shu Chen, Sutthana Koo-Anupong

### Project Overview
In traditional Yahtzee, players roll up to five dice three times per round, choosing which dice to keep in pursuit of specific combinations before filling one of the 13 scoring categories. Because the game involves randomness and requires adaptive decision-making, this project uses Monte Carlo simulation to analyze and optimize different strategies for playing Yahtzee.

### Objectives
1. Evaluate the performance of different strategies in a large number of repeated games under standard rules.
2. After modifying the game rules, to study how different rules affect the optimal strategies and average scores.

### Hypothesis
H1: Under the standard Yahtzee rules, the probability-based strategy (which assesses the expected value by using a probability model to evaluate the expected gain from each retained/re-drawn die) will outperform the random strategy or the greedy strategy, resulting in a higher average score.

H2: Changing the number of dice from 3 to 4 will change which strategy achieves the highest average score.

H3: Altering the scoring card in such as removing the “Full House” category or doubling the score of “Four of a Kind” will change which strategy yields the highest average score
